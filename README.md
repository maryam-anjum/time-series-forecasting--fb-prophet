Project Name: FB-Prophet Time Series Forecasting
Overview:
This project involves forecasting future values using the FB-Prophet time series forecasting model. The dataset used for this project contains daily temperature readings from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and the goal is to predict the future temperatures based on historical data.

Key Features: 
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and formatted the dataset for Prophet's expected input.
Modeling with FB-Prophet: Built and trained the model to predict the next 365 days of temperatures.
Evaluation: Calculated the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure model accuracy.
